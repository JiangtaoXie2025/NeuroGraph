# Multimodal Fusion Experiments

In this folder, you can find scripts and resources for experiments involving multiple data modalities (e.g., EEG + fMRI).

Contents:
- Data loading routines for combined EEG and fMRI datasets.
- Model architectures or modules specifically designed for multimodal inputs.
- Result files and logs detailing performance gains or comparisons against single-modality baselines.

Usage:
- Check the scripts or notebooks here to run or reproduce the multimodal experiments.
- Ensure you have the corresponding datasets (e.g., processed EEG and fMRI) available in the expected directory structure.
