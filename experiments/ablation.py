# Ablation Experiments

This folder is dedicated to ablation studies, where specific components of the model or training pipeline are removed or replaced to analyze their impact on performance.

Contents:
- Scripts for running ablation experiments (e.g., disabling certain modules).
- Result files or logs comparing different ablated configurations.

Usage:
- Refer to project documentation or scripts inside this folder for details on how to initiate each ablation run.
- Modify parameters (such as disabling specific layers or changing hyperparameters) to observe their effect on performance.
